## Customization

### Theme

The project uses a custom teal theme which can be modified in the `globals.css` file.

### Components

UI components are built using shadcn/ui. To add more components:

```bash
# For workspace projects (using pnpm)
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name> -w

# Example: Adding a button component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -w
```

Note: The `-w` flag is required when using pnpm workspaces to ensure the component is added to the root workspace.

## Deploy on Vercel

The project is configured for seamless deployment on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. Import your project to Vercel:

   - Go to [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Choose your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings

3. Environment Variables:

   - Copy variables from `.env.example` to your Vercel project
   - Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the required environment variables
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production URL

4. Deploy:
   - Vercel will automatically deploy your project
   - Each push to the main branch will trigger a new deployment
   - Preview deployments are created for branches matching:
     - `dev`
     - `feature/*`
     - `fix/*`

### Branch Previews

The project is configured to automatically create preview deployments for different branches:

- `main` - Production deployment
- `dev` - Development environment
- `feature/*` - Feature branch previews
- `fix/*` - Bug fix previews

Each preview deployment will have its own URL and environment, making it easy to test changes before merging to main.

To create a preview deployment:

1. Create a new branch with the appropriate prefix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-fix
   ```
2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```
3. Vercel will automatically create a preview deployment
4. The preview URL will be available in your Vercel dashboard and GitHub PR

For more details, check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).

### Production Checks

Before deploying:

- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Test the production build locally:
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  pnpm start
  ```
- Check the [deployment documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) for more information
